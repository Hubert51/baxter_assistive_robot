## open the doors and transfer the food container
    The main script makes the baxter on wheel open the fridge door
    and take out a food container and put it into the microwave oven when
    it is at the approximately-correct position
## Something needs to mention
    The location of initialization files need to be specified in the main script
## RobotRaconteur
Use RobotRaconteur to control the baxter robot. The matlab code is like a layer of interface. The actual control code is python code running with ros.
